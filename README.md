### Abstract

> How do intersecting identities influence candidate preference among
> members of pan-ethnic racial groups? In this paper we examine how
> racial, gender, and intersectional dimensions of linked fate shaped
> candidate preferences among Asian and Latino Americans in the 2020
> presidential election. Drawing on a post-election survey with a large
> over-sample of non-white respondents, we employ Bayesian multilevel
> regression with post-stratification (MrP) to examine variation in the
> role of linked fate within pan-ethnic identity groups. Our results
> suggest intersectional linked fate is a strong negative predictor of
> support for Trump among both Asian and Latino respondents. We also
> find heterogeneity in this relationship across pan-ethnic subgroups,
> particularly among those who express lower levels of linked fate.
